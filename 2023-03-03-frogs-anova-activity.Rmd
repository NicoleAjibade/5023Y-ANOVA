## How does frogspawn hatching time vary with temperature?

```{r read data}
frogs <- read_csv("data/frogs_messy_data.csv")

head(frogs)
```

```{r frogs data}
summary(frogs)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
